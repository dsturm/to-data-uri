## Converts the value of the src attribute of a html img element to a data URI
HTML allows to not only specify what image should be displayed but also to inline the actual image data into the page's html.
This is usually done to optimize the loading of your web page. This extension simplifies that process greatly. Simply select
the src attribute of an img element on a html page and select 'Inline as Data URI' from the Command Pallette.
